            <li>Investors are enthusiastic about Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF)  and their Indonesian cobalt mining project because it is strategically located near the world’s largest user of cobalt: China.</li>
            <li>Chinese battery manufacturers want a ready supply of conflict-free cobalt and nickel.</li>
            <li>Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp.’s (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) project in Papua, Indonesia covers 5,000 Ha with 9 prospects, 5 of them drill-tested and with known cobalt-nickel deposits.</li>
            <li>Infrastructure to and around the project is excellent, allowing for year-round access, and a 45-minute drive on sealed roads from the airport and near a city with skilled labor ready to work.</li>
            <li>The Cyclops project is adjacent a deep tidewater with a tremendous potential for easy port access and direct shipping routes to China.</li>
            <li>Shares of Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) continue to gain momentum as investors see Indonesia as potentially the world’s largest supplier of vital battery metals.</li>

              <li>Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers of nickel</li>
              <li>Cobalt is a by-product of nickel mining and modern mineral processing options may unlock the massive potential Indonesia holds for cobalt resources</li>
              <li>Indonesia is strategically located in the backyard of the world's largest battery market – China. This gives Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) a distinct advantage over cobalt explorers located in the West or in Africa.</li>
              <li>Indonesia has begun to attract billions of dollars in investment from multi-national mining and technology firms and individual investors intent on securing future production rights and financial gains</li>
              <li>Indonesian Maritime Minister, Luhut Pandjaitan says Indonesia will “become the main player in lithium batteries” and that it will “control the world market” as developers begin construction of $4 billion EV battery project on Sulawesi, backed by a consortium of investors from China, Japan, and South Korea</li>
              <li>Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. recognized this opportunity early and seized the moment by acquiring a large, advanced cobalt - nickel prospect located on tide water, with direct shipping routes to China.  Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) plans to systematically unlock the potentially significant value this mineralized asset may hold.</li>

              <p>For potential investors, this clearly demonstrates that Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. saw and seized an opportunity, which is a move the smartest investors make every day.</p>

            <hr class='bg-grey'>
          </div>
          <p>China is the No.1 user of Cobalt and their demand is growing. China is pushing for an aggressive California-style Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program that requires 12% of all cars sold in China to be EVs by 2020. Given a 1% EV adoption rate in China today, that target translates to a 12x increase in the number of electric cars sold in China by end of the decade. Cobalt is now rated a “strategically important metal” meaning the US government can arbitrarily create shortages.</p>

          <p>In July 2018, Pacific Rim Cobalt (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) entered into a preliminary agreement with Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co., Ltd. a leading specialized supplier of cathode material for lithium-ion batteries to industry giants such as Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, SK Continental and BYD. Easpring engages in the research, development, production and sale of energy materials and is an industry leader supplying five of the world’s six largest lithium battery manufacturers.</p>

          <p>"We are excited and optimistic about the unique possibility of developing this project into an asset that will add shareholder value and position the company to play a future role in the battery metals supply chain. It's going to be a busy year ahead, and we look forward to getting the drills turning and building value." - Ranjeet Sundher, CEO, Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF)</p>
